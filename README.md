## Project Overview
### This repository showcases my work on a comprehensive ride-hailing service project, which I undertook during the CS-120: Web Programming & Engineering course at Tufts University as part of my Master's Program.

### Part 1: Mapping Vehicles
#### In the initial phase of the project, the objective was to lay the foundation for the ride-hailing service. I focused on creating a webpage featuring a Google Map adorned with vehicle markers positioned at specific locations.

### Part 2: Dynamic Map Content
#### Part 2 marked the second phase of the project, where the emphasis shifted to dynamic map content. Within this lab, I implemented functionalities to determine the user's geolocation, placed a marker on the map reflecting that location, interacted with a ride-hailing API to display vehicles on the map, showcased an information window indicating the nearest vehicle along with its distance from the user, and visualized a polyline connecting the user's location to the closest vehicle.

### Part 3: Server-Side Implementation
#### The third and final phase revolved around rebuilding the server-side infrastructure to handle user ride requests. Using a provided API (https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides), I facilitated ride requests in the server-side application. The utilization of Heroku was pivotal in successfully reconstructing the server-side, ensuring the seamless functioning of the map in response to user interactions.
