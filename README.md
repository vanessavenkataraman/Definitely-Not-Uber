## This repository contains my work from Labs 8,10 and 12 of CS-120: Web Programming & Engineering

### The purpose of lab 8 was to start creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 8 is the first part of the project. In lab 8, the goal was to create a page that displays a Google Map with vehicle markers at specific locations.

### One of the major takeaways of lab 8 was the power of performance optimizations.

#### Before optimization:

##### 188 requests
##### 372 kB transferred
##### 6.1 MB resources
##### Finish: 18.14 s
##### DOMContentLoaded: 259 ms
##### Load: 594 ms

#### After optimization:

##### 149 requests
##### 39.5 kB transferred
##### 5.7 MB resources
##### Finish: 1.20 s
##### DOMContentLoaded: 128 ms
##### Load: 1.20 s

##### All aspects of lab 8 have been correctly implemented. I spent approximately 4 hours completing this lab. I utilized ChatGPT, Mozilla, StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks for syntax information and implementation strategies.

### The purpose of lab 10 was to continue creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 10 is the second part of the project. In lab 10, the goal was to populate the map with dynamic content. Throughout this lab, I determined the user's geolocation and placed a marker on the map at that location, made a request to a ride-hailing API and marked the returned vehicles onto the map, displayed an information window noting the closest vehicle from the user's location including the distance away in miles, and rendered a polyline that connects the user's location to the closest vehicle.

##### All aspects of lab 10 have been correctly implemented. I spent approximately 12 hours completing this lab. I utilized ChatGPT, Mozilla, StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks for syntax information and implementation strategies. I also utilized the sites listed in the instructions of the lab as resources.

### The purpose of lab 12 was to continue creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 12 is the third part of the project. In lab 12, the goal was to recreate the server-side that will respond to a user's request for a ride. In part 2, I used a given API to request a ride: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides. In this lab, the server-side must be recreated in order to make the map work again.

##### All bare-minimum aspects of lab 12 have been correctly implemented. I spent approximately 5 hours completing this lab. I utilized ChatGPT, Mozilla, StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks for syntax information and implementation strategies. I also utilized the sites listed in the instructions of the lab as resources.
