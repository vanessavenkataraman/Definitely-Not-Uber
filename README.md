## This repository contains my work from Labs 8,10 and 12 of CS-120: Web Programming & Engineering

### The purpose of lab 8 was to start creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 8 is the first part of the project. In lab 8, the goal was to create a page that displays a Google Map with vehicle markers at specific locations.

### The purpose of lab 10 was to continue creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 10 is the second part of the project. In lab 10, the goal was to populate the map with dynamic content. Throughout this lab, I determined the user's geolocation and placed a marker on the map at that location, made a request to a ride-hailing API and marked the returned vehicles onto the map, displayed an information window noting the closest vehicle from the user's location including the distance away in miles, and rendered a polyline that connects the user's location to the closest vehicle.

### The purpose of lab 12 was to continue creating a ride-hailing service. Lab 12 is the third part of the project. In lab 12, the goal was to recreate the server-side that will respond to a user's request for a ride. In part 2, I used a given API to request a ride: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides. In this lab, the server-side must be recreated in order to make the map work again. I utilized Heroku to build the server-side application.
